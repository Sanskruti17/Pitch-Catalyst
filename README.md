This Android project is a simple checklist application built using Kotlin and Firebase. It follows a clean architecture design pattern to ensure scalability and maintainability.

Features
Checklist Creation: Users can create checklist items with a title, a body, and a checkbox for each item.

Firebase Integration: The app seamlessly integrates with Firebase to perform CRUD operations on the checklist items.

Add Item: Users can add items to the checklist by inputting the title and body values. This data is then stored in Firebase Firestore.

Delete Item: Checked items can be easily deleted from the checklist. When a user checks an item, it is automatically removed from the list and from the Firebase database.
